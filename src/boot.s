// this assembly file *shouldn't* be necessary, it should be possible to

// have that - check cpuid (inline asm to get mpidr_el1).
//   if â‰  0, while(true) wfi
// have that set up a stack and call a function to clear bss
// after clearing bss, call main
// this loses the arguments dtb_ptr32: u64, x1: u64, x2: u64, x3: u64
// it is also more annoying to set the stack because zig expects a slice
//   while assembly is able to just set the stack end ptr and extern
//   variables don't have an option to say align(std.Target.stack_align)
// it also is more annoying to clear the bss because ptr math and extern
//   variables don't have an option to say align(16)
